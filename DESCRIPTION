Description: 
    We aim to deal with the average treatment effect (ATE), where the data are
    subject to high-dimensionality and measurement error. This package primarily contains two 
    functions, which are used to generate artificial data and estimate ATE with high-dimensional 
    and error-prone data accommodated.
